    I know I say this a lot and yet it feels like I canâ€™t possibly say it enough, you
    have changed my vision of myself on so many levels. You have helped me heal me so
    much. I can never thank you enough."

- quote: "Thanks for the wonderful session tonight. I already experienced some \"fruit\"
    from it. After I came home, I went to the outdoor space, in the park - behind
    our fence, where I decided I will go and enjoy my beautiful fox gloves
    blooming profusely. During Qi-kong, people told me how to enjoy flowers
    more than regular - spread the arms, ask their permission for giving me
    their energy and it was AMAZING,the energy flow was beautiful, my heart
    was filled with joy, then a breeze came along and it felt like they were
    talking to me through their movement, I spent about half hour truly enjoying
    them and being grateful to Creator for their being.  Much gratitude to you too!"
