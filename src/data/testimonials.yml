- quote: "Thank you for everything. This body is grateful for the time I allowed
    it to rest this past week. All the physical challenges that would have thrown
    me into a depression and stricken me with self loathing and despair did the opposite.
    I know I say this a lot and yet it feels like I can’t possibly say it enough, you
    have changed my vision of myself on so many levels. You have helped me heal me so
    much. I can never thank you enough."

- quote: "When I read the description of EFT in a brochure, I thought that it
    sounded like exactly what I needed to help me out of my funk.  It was
    amazing! After just one session, I slept all night for the first time in
    months! I tapped every night on my own in between sessions at the yoga
    center and was thrilled to discover that day by day I felt a little less
    anxious and a whole lot happier. I found myself thinking more about the
    things that I could affect in a positive way and moving away from dwelling
    on those that were negative and emotionally burdensome. The physical act
    of tapping (a kind of psychological acupressure) and the brilliance of the
    instructor, Gina, who is able to weave the group members’ concerns into a calming,
    yet powerfully affirmative narrative create a wonderful, relaxing
    environment. I will be a regular at EFT. \nThank you."

- quote: "Thanks for the wonderful session tonight. I already experienced some \"fruit\"
    from it. After I came home, I went to the outdoor space, in the park - behind
    our fence, where I decided I will go and enjoy my beautiful fox gloves
    blooming profusely. During Qi-kong, people told me how to enjoy flowers
    more than regular - spread the arms, ask their permission for giving me
    their energy and it was AMAZING,the energy flow was beautiful, my heart
    was filled with joy, then a breeze came along and it felt like they were
    talking to me through their movement, I spent about half hour truly enjoying
    them and being grateful to Creator for their being.  Much gratitude to you too!"
  author: "S.K."
- quote: "Gina would from time to time ask me to state something for which I was
    grateful and then as I responded tapped various tuning forks, which emitted
    pleasant sounds and vibrations. Sometimes she rested the vibrating forks intuitively
    on various parts of my body. As if by magic, Gina found the places in my body that
    needed healing most and cleared toxins from them."
  author: "V.M."
- quote: "Gaining insight into our uncouncious habits, beliefs, and imprints takes
    courage, action, time and investing in yourself.\n
